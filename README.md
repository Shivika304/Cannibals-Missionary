This project is a Python-based solution to the Cannibals and Missionaries Problem, a classic river-crossing puzzle. The objective is to safely transport three missionaries and three cannibals across the river using a boat, while ensuring that cannibals never outnumber missionaries on either side.

Features:
✅ Implements state-space search algorithms (BFS/DFS) to find a solution.
✅ Ensures game rules are followed to avoid invalid states.
✅ Interactive console-based gameplay.

How It Works:
The boat can carry one or two people at a time.
Cannibals must never outnumber missionaries on either riverbank.
The goal is to safely transport all individuals across the river.
This project demonstrates problem-solving techniques using AI search algorithms in Python. Future enhancements may include a graphical interface (GUI) for better visualization.
